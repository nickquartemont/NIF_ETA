The 129 group structure was created specifically for use at 14 MeV neutron sources.  It has a much finer group structure at higher neutron energies so that you can use a much better calculation of the neutron flux in the 13 to 15 MeV region.  We have found that this is critical when used at our D-T neutron generator since some of the cross sections have a steep energy dependence in this region.  When you right click on the directory containing your input spectrum, the window that opens will ask you what group structure you want to use and type in 129.  That automatically loads in the correct cross section and covariance libraries.  However, to get the neutron self-shielding to work correctly, you will have to rerun the SHIELD module using the 129 group instead of the 140 group energy structure to get the right cross section group shielding factors.  I think this could fix the high chi2 value for the Ni58(n,2n) reaction.  I would also note that you have rather small uncertainties on the input neutron spectrum and that doesn't give you much room for any adjustment of the spectrum.  This may be the statistical uncertainties from your calculations but may not consider uncertainties in the neutron cross section data used by codes such as MCNP.  Increasing these input uncertainties may result in much better fits to your data.  The problem with the W186(n,g) reaction is harder to diagnose.   The other three (n,gamma) reactions seem to agree very well so it is odd that the W186 reaction doesn't agree with the others.  Maybe review the data for any possible problems.  Gamma self-absorption corrections may also be needed.
