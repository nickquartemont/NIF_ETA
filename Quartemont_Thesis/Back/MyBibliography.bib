Nuclear forensic evidence helps law enforcement and intelligence agencies work toward preventing, mitigating, and attributing a nuclear or radiological incident. This report, requested by DHS, the National Nuclear Security Administration, and the Department of Defense, makes recommendations on how to sustain and improve U.S. nuclear forensics capabilities.\n\nThe United States has developed a nuclear forensics capability that has been demonstrated in real-world incidents of interdicted materials and in exercises of actions required after a nuclear detonation.

@article{Gooden2016,
	abstract = {Fission Product Yields (FPY) have historically been one of the most observable features of the fission process. They are known to have strong variations that are dependent on the fissioning species, the excitation energy, and the angular momentum of the compound system. However, consistent and systematic studies of the variation of these FPY with energy have proved challenging. This is caused primarily by the nature of the experiments that have traditionally relied on radiochemical procedures to isolate specific fission products. Although radiochemical procedures exist that can isolate all products, each element presents specific challenges and introduces varying degrees of systematic errors that can make inter-comparison of FPY uncertain. Although of high importance in fields such as nuclear forensics and Stockpile Stewardship, accurate information about the energy dependence of neutron induced FPY are sparse, due primarily to the lack of suitable monoenergetic neutron sources. There is a clear need for improved data, and to address this issue, a collaboration was formed between Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and the Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory (TUNL) to measure the energy dependence of FPY for235U,238U and239Pu. The measurements have been performed at TUNL, using a 10 MV Tandem Van de Graaff accelerator to produce monoenergetic neutrons at energies between 0.6 MeV to 14.8 MeV through a variety of reactions. The measurements have utilized a dual-fission chamber, with thin (10-100 $\mu$g/cm2) reference foils of similar material to a thick (100-400 mg) activation target held in the center between the chambers. This method allows for the accurate determination of the number of fissions that occurred in the thick target without requiring knowledge of the fission cross section or neutron fluence on target. Following activation, the thick target was removed from the dual-fission chamber and gamma-ray counted using shielded HPGe detectors for a period of 1-2 months to determine the yield of various fission products. To the extent possible all irradiation and counting procedures were kept the same to minimize sources of systematic errors. FPY have been determined at incident neutron energies of 0.6, 1.4, 2.4, 3.5, 4.6, 5.5, 8.9 and 14.8 MeV.},

Monte Carlo random sampling on the ENDF/B-VII.1 neutron-induced nuclear data was performed using the SANDY code developed at the Belgian nuclear research center SCK•CEN. SANDY was proved to be a successful tool for uncertainty quantification in the model case of a MA burner SFR. The results show that despite the high content in MAs, the contribution of U-238 data is still dominant in most instances, especially the inelastic scattering cross section data. Minor actinides together with Pu make up to 33{\%} of the total calculated keffuncertainty, which amounts to ±1345pcm of reactivity. Relative uncertainty greater than ±3.47{\%} was estimated for $\beta$effwith significant contribution from the prompt multiplicity data of U-238 and Pu-239. Relative uncertainty on the Doppler reactivity worth was found to be at least ±12.6{\%}. Coolant voiding in different core zones yields reactivity worth with relative uncertainties whose lower bounds range from ±6.37{\%} to ±22.47{\%} depending on the voiding conditions, with important contributions due to the Na-23 nuclear data uncertainty.},

	abstract = {Several methodologies using different levels of approximations have been developed for propagating nuclear data uncertainties in nuclear burn-up simulations. Most methods fall into the two broad classes of Monte Carlo approaches, which are exact apart from statistical uncertainties but require additional computation time, and first order perturbation theory approaches, which are efficient for not too large numbers of considered response functions but only applicable for sufficiently small nuclear data uncertainties. Some methods neglect isotopic composition uncertainties induced by the depletion steps of the simulations, others neglect neutron flux uncertainties, and the accuracy of a given approximation is often very hard to quantify. In order to get a better sense of the impact of different approximations, this work aims to compare results obtained based on different approximate methodologies with an exact method, namely the NUDUNA Monte Carlo based approach developed by AREVA GmbH. In addition, the impact of different covariance data is studied by comparing two of the presently most complete nuclear data covariance libraries (ENDF/B-VII.1 and SCALE 6.0), which reveals a high dependency of the uncertainty estimates on the source of covariance data. The burn-up benchmark Exercise I-1b proposed by the OECD expert group "Benchmarks for Uncertainty Analysis in Modeling (UAM) for the Design, Operation and Safety Analysis of LWRs" is studied as an example application. The burn-up simulations are performed with the SCALE 6.0 tool suite.},

Existing SS-based methods have demonstrated the feasibility and efficiency of propagating uncertainties in multigroup nuclear data. However, in fields such as criticality safety assessment, pointwise representation of nuclear data is more appropriate in order to corroborate the increasing safety demand and best-estimate modeling capabilities. In this work, an SS-based tool, called NUSS is implemented which perturbs pointwise ACE-formatted nuclear data using multigroup nuclear data covariance. The use of pointwise ACE-formatted nuclear data in NUSS can accommodate flexible multigroup covariance structures and allows for nuclear data uncertainty propagation through the continuous/pointwise-energy transport code MCNPX. As a first step of the NUSS development and verification, uncertainty contributions from239Pu and235U nuclear data were assessed for Jezebel (Pu-fueled) and Godiva (U-fueled) fast-spectrum criticality benchmarks. NUSS results are compared to those by other uncertainty quantification methods such as TSUNAMI and MCNPX PERT CARD. Next, Light Water Reactor (LWR) pin cell models from the OECD/NEA UAM Phase-1 benchmark were analyzed.

	abstract = {The Very High Temperature Critical Assembly (VHTRC) experiment represents one of the few data sets available for the validation of HTGR lattice physics. Within the framework of the IAEA Coordinated Research Project on HTGR Uncertainty Analysis in Modeling, uncertainty and sensitivity analyses of this graphite-moderated facility are performed as the validation reference to the prismatic MHTGR-350 fuel block calculations. Nominal multi-group and continuous-energy criticality calculations with the KENO-VI Monte Carlo code of the SCALE code package are compared with the continuous-energy Monte Carlo Code Serpent. Good agreement with a maximum difference of 250 pcm is obtained. The experimental data set, however, differs by several hundred pcm with the results of both codes when using the ENDF-VII.0 library. When using ENDF/B-VII.1 data, this difference is reduced to a few hundred pcm and the calculations lie within the experimental error bars. Uncertainties of the VHTRC multiplication factors due to uncertainties in nuclear data are determined with SAMPLER/KENO-VI of SCALE 6.2 and with continuous-energy TSUNAMI of SCALE 6.2. For all experimental configurations, the obtained uncertainty is found to be 0.58{\%} when using ENDF/B-VII.0 data. The top contributor to this uncertainty is the average number of neutrons per fission event of U-235. With ENDF/B-VII.1 data, uncertainties of about 0.66{\%} are obtained in particular due to an increased uncertainty of U-235 nu-bar in the latest ENDF release. When considering these nuclear data uncertainties, the obtained 1$\sigma$ uncertainty intervals are overlapping with the experimental error bars.},

@article{Burns2017,
	abstract = {The aftermath of the Tōhoku earthquake and the Fukushima accident has led to a global push to improve the safety of existing light water reactors. A key component of this initiative is the development of nuclear fuel and cladding materials with potentially enhanced accident tolerance, also known as accident-tolerant fuels (ATF). These materials are intended to improve core fuel and cladding integrity under beyond design basis accident conditions while maintaining or enhancing reactor performance and safety characteristics during normal operation. To complement research that has already been carried out to characterize ATF neutronics, the present study provides an initial investigation of the sensitivity and uncertainty of ATF systems responses to nuclear cross section data. ATF concepts incorporate novel materials, including SiC and FeCrAl cladding and high density uranium silicide composite fuels, in turn introducing new cross section sensitivities and uncertainties which may behave differently from traditional fuel and cladding materials. In this paper, we conducted sensitivity and uncertainty analysis using the TSUNAMI-2D sequence of SCALE with infinite lattice models of ATF assemblies. Of all the ATF materials considered, it is found that radiative capture in56Fe in FeCrAl cladding is the most significant contributor to eigenvalue uncertainty.56Fe yields significant potential eigenvalue uncertainty associated with its radiative capture cross section; this is by far the largest ATF-specific uncertainty found in these cases, exceeding even those of uranium. We found that while significant new sensitivities indeed arise, the general sensitivity behavior of ATF assemblies does not markedly differ from traditional UO2/zirconium-based fuel/cladding systems, especially with regard to uncertainties associated with uranium. We assessed the similarity of the IPEN/MB-01 reactor benchmark model to application models with FeCrAl cladding. We used TSUNAMI-IP to calculate similarity indices of the application model and IPEN/MB-01 reactor benchmark model. This benchmark was selected for its use of SS304 as a cladding and structural material, with significant56Fe content. The similarity indices suggest that while many differences in reactor physics arise from differences in design, sensitivity to and behavior of56Fe absorption is comparable between systems, thus indicating the potential for this benchmark to reduce uncertainties in56Fe radiative capture cross sections.},

The "blackbox" approach of stochastic sampling (SS) methods for simultaneous nuclear data uncertainty quantification is powerful except it reveals little of the individual uncertainty contributions. In this work, the SS-based tool "NUSS" (nuclear data uncertainty stochastic sampling) developed at  is updated to "NUSS-RF" which estimates individual nuclear data uncertainty contributions to the total output uncertainty. The new capability is based on the Random balance design and Fourier amplitude sensitivity testing methods, both belonging to the so-called global sensitivity analysis. First, the implementation of NUSS-RF is tested using a mathematical function, followed by the sensitivity and uncertainty analysis for 235 U(n,$\gamma$) and 238 U(n,$\gamma$) cross sections in Godiva and BWR pincell benchmarks, respectively. The results are compared to the deterministic sensitivity/uncertainty "Sandwich Rule" approach which is local. For uncorrelated inputs, both methods have the equivalent interpretation of the input uncertainty contribution (in terms of variance fraction and sensitivity index), hence producing good agreement in the results. For correlated inputs, the discrepancy between the two methods broadens with the extent of the correlations.},

@article{Wieselquist2013,
	abstract = {Capabilities for uncertainty quantification (UQ) with respect to nuclear data have been developed at PSI in the recent years and applied to the UAM benchmark. The guiding principle for the PSI UQ development has been to implement nonintrusive "black box" UQ techniques in state-of-the-art, production-quality codes used already for routine analyses. Two complimentary UQ techniques have been developed thus far: (i) direct perturbation (DP) and (ii) stochastic sampling (SS). The DP technique is, first and foremost, a robust and versatile sensitivity coefficient calculation, applicable to all types of input and output. Using standard uncertainty propagation, the sensitivity coefficients are folded with variance/covariance matrices (VCMs) leading to a local first-order UQ method. The complementary SS technique samples uncertain inputs according to their joint probability distributions and provides a global, all-order UQ method. This paper describes both DP and SS implemented in the lattice physics code CASMO-5MX (a special PSI-modified version of CASMO-5M) and a preliminary SS technique implemented in MCNPX, routinely used in criticality safety and fluence analyses. Results are presented for the UAM benchmark exercises I-1 (cell) and I-2 (assembly). ? 2013 W. Wieselquist et al.},

This new technique, based on the Bohr-independence hypothesis, permits the measurement of fission yields from an alternate reaction pathway (Th-232 + 25.6 MeV α → U-236* vs. U-235 + 14-MeV n → U-236*) given that the fission process associated with the same compound nucleus is independent of its formation.

The composition of nuclear fallout is complex, with widely varying isotopic compositions (Fahey et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 107(47):20207–20212, 2010; Bellucci et al., Anal Chem 85:7588–7593, 2013;Wallace et al., J Radioanal Nucl Chem, 2013; Belloni et al., J Environ Radioact 102:852–862, 2011; Freiling, Science 139:1058– 1059, 1963; Science 133:1991–1999, 1961;Bunney and Sam Government Report: Naval Ordinance Laboratory, White Oak, 1971). As the gaseous cloud traverses from hotter to cooler regions of the atmosphere, the processes of conden- sation and nucleation entrain environmental materials, vaporized nuclear materials and fission products. The ele- mental and isotopic composition of the fission products is altered due to chemical fractionation (i.e. the fission product composition that would be expected from fission of the ori- ginal nuclear material is altered by differences in condensa- tion rates of the elements); the fallout may be enriched or depleted in volatile or refractory fission products. This paper describes preliminary work to synthesize, irradiate and frac- tionate the fission product content of irradiated particulate glass using a thermal distillation 2 h after irradiation. The glass was synthesized using a solution-based polymerization of tetraethyl orthosilicate. (Izrael, Radioactive fallout after nuclear explosions and accidents, 2002) Uranium was incorporated into the glass particulate at trace concentrations during polymerization. The particulate was subjected to a short thermal neutron irradiation then heated to 1,273 K approximately 2 h after the end of irradiation. Fission pro- ducts of 133, 134, 135I, 132, 134Te, 135Xe, 138Cs and 91, 92Sr were observed to be distilled from the particulate. The results of these preliminary studies are discussed.},

The ETA was characterized at the 88-Inch Cyclotron at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory to measure the shaped spectrum from an incident deuteron breakup neutron source, test the proposed neutron spectroscopy techniques used to inform the flux measurements at NIF, and validate the ability to predict ETA performance using a Monte Carlo Neutral Particle (MCNP) simulation. Activation foils (i.e., Ni, In, Au, Al) were exposed to a collimated 33-MeV deuteron-breakup beam originating from a tantalum breakup target. The source spectrum absent the ETA was characterized using a set of activation foils and the STAYSL unfolding code. Finally, the ETA-modified spectrum was obtained using activation foil unfolding with a χ2ν=1.32. The ETA-modified unfolded spectrum agreed with the MCNP-simulated prediction in the energy range of 0.1–14 MeV, but exhibited disagreements in the 10 eV–100 keV region. This work demonstrates shaping of the NIF neutron spectrum via the ETA to be a viable path forward for tailored neutron beams at NIF."

Their application called for a fast-running, portable mission-planning tool for use in response to emerging improvised nuclear device (IND) post-detonation situations. The project met those goals by research and development of models to predict the physical, chemical, and radiological properties of fallout debris. ORNL has developed new graphical user interfaces for two existing codes, the Oak Ridge Isotope Generation (ORIGEN) code and the Defense Land Fallout Interpretive Code (DELFIC). ORIGEN is a validated, radionuclide production and decay code that has been implemented into the Fallout Analysis Tool to predict the fallout source term nuclide inventory after the detonation of an IND. DELFIC is a validated, physics-based, research reference fallout prediction software package. It has been implemented into the Fallout Planning Tool and is used to predict the fractionated isotope concentrations in fallout, particle sizes, fractionation ratios, dose rate, and integrated dose over the planned collection routes - information vital to ensure quality samples for nuclear forensic analysis while predicting dose to the sample collectors. DELFIC contains a particle activity module, which models the radiochemical fractionation of the elements in a cooling fireball as they condense into and onto particles to predict the fractionated activity size distribution for a given scenario. This provides the most detailed physics-based characterization of the fallout source term phenomenology available in an operational fallout model.},

@article{Schmidt2016,
	abstract = {The GEF ("GEneral description of Fission observables") model code is documented. It describes the observables for spontaneous fission, neutron-induced fission and, more generally, for fission of a compound nucleus from any other entrance channel, with given excitation energy and angular momentum. The GEF model is applicable for a wide range of isotopes from Z = 80 to Z = 112 and beyond, up to excitation energies of about 100 MeV. The results of the GEF model are compared with fission barriers, fission probabilities, fission-fragment mass- and nuclide distributions, isomeric ratios, total kinetic energies, and prompt-neutron and prompt-gamma yields and energy spectra from neutron-induced and spontaneous fission. Derived properties of delayed neutrons and decay heat are also considered.The GEF model is based on a general approach to nuclear fission that explains a great part of the complex appearance of fission observables on the basis of fundamental laws of physics and general properties of microscopic systems and mathematical objects. The topographic theorem is used to estimate the fission-barrier heights from theoretical macroscopic saddle-point and ground-state masses and experimental ground-state masses. Motivated by the theoretically predicted early localisation of nucleonic wave functions in a necked-in shape, the properties of the relevant fragment shells are extracted. These are used to determine the depths and the widths of the fission valleys corresponding to the different fission channels and to describe the fission-fragment distributions and deformations at scission by a statistical approach. A modified composite nuclear-level-density formula is proposed. It respects some features in the superfluid regime that are in accordance with new experimental findings and with theoretical expectations. These are a constant-temperature behaviour that is consistent with a considerably increased heat capacity and an increased pairing condensation energy that is consistent with the collective enhancement of the level density. The exchange of excitation energy and nucleons between the nascent fragments on the way from saddle to scission is estimated according to statistical mechanics. As a result, excitation energy and unpaired nucleons are predominantly transferred to the heavy fragment in the superfluid regime. This description reproduces some rather peculiar observed features of the prompt-neutron multiplicities and of the even-odd effect in fission-fragment Z distributions. For completeness, some conventional descriptions are used for calculating pre-equilibrium emission, fission probabilities and statistical emission of neutrons and gamma radiation from the excited fragments. Preference is given to simple models that can also be applied to exotic nuclei compared to more sophisticated models that need precise empirical input of nuclear properties, e.g. spectroscopic information.The approach reveals a high degree of regularity and provides a considerable insight into the physics of the fission process. Fission observables can be calculated with a precision that complies with the needs for applications in nuclear technology without specific adjustments to measured data of individual systems. The GEF executable runs out of the box with no need for entering any empirical data. This unique feature is of valuable importance, because the number of systems and energies of potential significance for fundamental and applied science will never be possible to be measured. The relevance of the approach for examining the consistency of experimental results and for evaluating nuclear data is demonstrated.},
