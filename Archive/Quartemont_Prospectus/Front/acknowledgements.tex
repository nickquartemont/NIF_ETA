Foremost I wish to acknowledge God for blessing me with the
opportunity to serve my country and for giving me the necessary
talents and abilities to complete this challenging project.

Next I would like to recognize my wife's unseen but priceless
contribution.  She selflessly shielded me from the demands of
everyday life and commandeered virtually all family duties, at
significant personal sacrifice, so that I could focus solely on this
research.  I owe her one and a half years of life back.

I would also like to thank my research advisor, Lt Col Ariel
Acebal, for his tough-love mentorship and intolerance for mediocrity.
He cared enough to make life hard for me, helping me to become both a
better student and officer.

Likewise I extend my thanks to my thesis committee members, Dr 
William Bailey, and Lt Col Robb Randall, as well as to the
amazingly smart scientists at Utah State University: Drs Robert
Schunk, Larry Gardner, Ludger Scherliess and Lie Zhu.  Their guidance
and insight were enormously helpful.

Lastly I would like to thank my classmates, Captains Ken Fenton,
Janelle Jenniges, Omar Nava, and Lt Paul Domm.  I could not have
asked for a better group of friends with whom to share the ups and
downs of these formative months at AFIT.
