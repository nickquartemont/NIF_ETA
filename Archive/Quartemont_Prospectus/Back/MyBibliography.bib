Quantitative comparison of these experimentally measured fission yields with the evaluated fission yields from 14-MeV neutron-induced fission of U-235 demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed fission-proxy method. This new technique, based on the Bohr-independence hypothesis, permits the measurement of fission yields from an alternate reaction pathway (Th-232 + 25.6 MeV α → U-236* vs. U-235 + 14-MeV n → U-236*) given that the fission process associated with the same compound nucleus is independent of its formation. Other suitable systems that can potentially be investigated in this manner include (but are not limited to) Pu-239 and U-237.},

@article{Carney2014b,
	abstract = {The production of glass that emulates fallout is desired by the nuclear forensics community for training and measurement exercises. The composition of nuclear fallout is complex, with widely varying isotopic compositions (Fahey et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 107(47):20207–20212, 2010; Bellucci et al., Anal Chem 85:7588–7593, 2013;Wallace et al., J Radioanal Nucl Chem, 2013; Belloni et al., J Environ Radioact 102:852–862, 2011; Freiling, Science 139:1058– 1059, 1963; Science 133:1991–1999, 1961;Bunney and Sam Government Report: Naval Ordinance Laboratory, White Oak, 1971). As the gaseous cloud traverses from hotter to cooler regions of the atmosphere, the processes of conden- sation and nucleation entrain environmental materials, vaporized nuclear materials and fission products. The ele- mental and isotopic composition of the fission products is altered due to chemical fractionation (i.e. the fission product composition that would be expected from fission of the ori- ginal nuclear material is altered by differences in condensa- tion rates of the elements); the fallout may be enriched or depleted in volatile or refractory fission products. This paper describes preliminary work to synthesize, irradiate and frac- tionate the fission product content of irradiated particulate glass using a thermal distillation 2 h after irradiation. The glass was synthesized using a solution-based polymerization of tetraethyl orthosilicate. (Izrael, Radioactive fallout after nuclear explosions and accidents, 2002) Uranium was incorporated into the glass particulate at trace concentrations during polymerization. The particulate was subjected to a short thermal neutron irradiation then heated to 1,273 K approximately 2 h after the end of irradiation. Fission pro- ducts of 133, 134, 135I, 132, 134Te, 135Xe, 138Cs and 91, 92Sr were observed to be distilled from the particulate. The results of these preliminary studies are discussed.},

The aim is to give a pedagogical introduction to the subject without going into a detailed discussion of technical issues. The second part of this article concerns the evaluation of uncertainties. Spectra derived using unfolding techniques (and any quantities computed from these spectra; e.g., fluences and doses) will be subject to uncertainties and it is important to provide estimates of these uncertainties. This is not straightforward, due in part to the special role played by the prior information. It is shown that an approach using Bayesian parameter estimation can overcome these difficulties. {\textcopyright} 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The Very High Temperature Critical Assembly (VHTRC) experiment represents one of the few data sets available for the validation of HTGR lattice physics. Within the framework of the IAEA Coordinated Research Project on HTGR Uncertainty Analysis in Modeling, uncertainty and sensitivity analyses of this graphite-moderated facility are performed as the validation reference to the prismatic MHTGR-350 fuel block calculations. Nominal multi-group and continuous-energy criticality calculations with the KENO-VI Monte Carlo code of the SCALE code package are compared with the continuous-energy Monte Carlo Code Serpent. Good agreement with a maximum difference of 250 pcm is obtained. The experimental data set, however, differs by several hundred pcm with the results of both codes when using the ENDF-VII.0 library. When using ENDF/B-VII.1 data, this difference is reduced to a few hundred pcm and the calculations lie within the experimental error bars. Uncertainties of the VHTRC multiplication factors due to uncertainties in nuclear data are determined with SAMPLER/KENO-VI of SCALE 6.2 and with continuous-energy TSUNAMI of SCALE 6.2. For all experimental configurations, the obtained uncertainty is found to be 0.58{\%} when using ENDF/B-VII.0 data. The top contributor to this uncertainty is the average number of neutrons per fission event of U-235. With ENDF/B-VII.1 data, uncertainties of about 0.66{\%} are obtained in particular due to an increased uncertainty of U-235 nu-bar in the latest ENDF release. When considering these nuclear data uncertainties, the obtained 1$\sigma$ uncertainty intervals are overlapping with the experimental error bars.},

Our value of 806.89 \pm 0.11(stat)^{+0.23}_{-0.19}(syst) ms resolves a major discrepancy between previous measurements.

@article{Schmidt2016,
	abstract = {The GEF ("GEneral description of Fission observables") model code is documented. It describes the observables for spontaneous fission, neutron-induced fission and, more generally, for fission of a compound nucleus from any other entrance channel, with given excitation energy and angular momentum. The GEF model is applicable for a wide range of isotopes from Z = 80 to Z = 112 and beyond, up to excitation energies of about 100 MeV. The results of the GEF model are compared with fission barriers, fission probabilities, fission-fragment mass- and nuclide distributions, isomeric ratios, total kinetic energies, and prompt-neutron and prompt-gamma yields and energy spectra from neutron-induced and spontaneous fission. Derived properties of delayed neutrons and decay heat are also considered.The GEF model is based on a general approach to nuclear fission that explains a great part of the complex appearance of fission observables on the basis of fundamental laws of physics and general properties of microscopic systems and mathematical objects. The topographic theorem is used to estimate the fission-barrier heights from theoretical macroscopic saddle-point and ground-state masses and experimental ground-state masses. Motivated by the theoretically predicted early localisation of nucleonic wave functions in a necked-in shape, the properties of the relevant fragment shells are extracted. These are used to determine the depths and the widths of the fission valleys corresponding to the different fission channels and to describe the fission-fragment distributions and deformations at scission by a statistical approach. A modified composite nuclear-level-density formula is proposed. It respects some features in the superfluid regime that are in accordance with new experimental findings and with theoretical expectations. These are a constant-temperature behaviour that is consistent with a considerably increased heat capacity and an increased pairing condensation energy that is consistent with the collective enhancement of the level density. The exchange of excitation energy and nucleons between the nascent fragments on the way from saddle to scission is estimated according to statistical mechanics. As a result, excitation energy and unpaired nucleons are predominantly transferred to the heavy fragment in the superfluid regime. This description reproduces some rather peculiar observed features of the prompt-neutron multiplicities and of the even-odd effect in fission-fragment Z distributions. For completeness, some conventional descriptions are used for calculating pre-equilibrium emission, fission probabilities and statistical emission of neutrons and gamma radiation from the excited fragments. Preference is given to simple models that can also be applied to exotic nuclei compared to more sophisticated models that need precise empirical input of nuclear properties, e.g. spectroscopic information.The approach reveals a high degree of regularity and provides a considerable insight into the physics of the fission process. Fission observables can be calculated with a precision that complies with the needs for applications in nuclear technology without specific adjustments to measured data of individual systems. The GEF executable runs out of the box with no need for entering any empirical data. This unique feature is of valuable importance, because the number of systems and energies of potential significance for fundamental and applied science will never be possible to be measured. The relevance of the approach for examining the consistency of experimental results and for evaluating nuclear data is demonstrated.},
