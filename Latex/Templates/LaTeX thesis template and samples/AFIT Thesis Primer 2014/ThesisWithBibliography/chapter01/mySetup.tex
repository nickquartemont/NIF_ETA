Take the first steps in writing your thesis using the simple programs
described in this chapter as a guide.  The source code and support files can be
found on the student drive \primerAddress.  With a
current \Latex distribution\footnote{\Latex distributions update
annually in June.  As of June 2014, the current \Latex
distributions are MiKTeX 2.9 for Windows, TeX Live 2014 for Linux, and
MacTeX 2014 for Macintosh.}, you will be able to compile these programs
without hiccup.

The directory tree below provides a recommended file structure
for the papers generated in your research.  Directories follow ``$>$'' signs; 
standared\ files are
specified in parentheses.

} \noindent In a parent directory, create three directories
``afitStyleFiles'', ``Figures'', and ``Thesis''.  Place your graphics
(such as afitlogo.pdf) in the directory Figures, your \Latex style
files (afitThesis.sty, sf298.sty, sf298.dtx, and sf298.ins) in
afitStyleFiles, and the latex code for your thesis document in Thesis.
Organized in this way, the files in the Figures directory and the
afitStyleFiles directory can be used by your thesis, perspectus, archived drafts,
and other publications.  Typically, graphics account for most of the
memory taken up by a digital document, and this efficiency in
sharing saves significant disk space.
