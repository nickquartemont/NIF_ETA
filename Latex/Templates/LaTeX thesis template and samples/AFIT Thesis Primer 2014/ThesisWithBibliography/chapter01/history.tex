TeX is a typesetting system developed by mathematician and computer
scientist Dr Donald E. Knuth.  He is the author of the seminal multi-volume
The Art of Computer Programming" for which he won the Turing Award.

Dr Knuth had two goals for TeX: (1) To allow anyone to produce high
quality technical books using a reasonable amount of effort, (2) To
provide a system that would produce the same results now or in the
future.  \Latex is a popular tool in academia where high quality and
affordability in publishing is a must.
