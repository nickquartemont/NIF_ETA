The style file {\em afitThesis.sty} contains code that generates the
first, standardized pages of the thesis document.  Theses pages are the
flyleaf, disclaimer page, the title page, and the committee page.  For
each thesis, we customize these four pages by editing a tex file
called {\em titlePage.tex}.  The customizable items for a thesis are:

\vspace{-0.15in}
\begin{tabular}{p{2.2in}p{4in}}
    \begin{itemize}\itemsep-10pt
	    \item Author
	    \item Rank
	    \item Graduation Date
	    \item Document Designator
	    \item Flypage title
	    \item Title
     \end{itemize} &
    \begin{itemize}\itemsep-10pt
	    \item Previous degrees
	    \item Academic degree upon AFIT graduation
	    \item Committee membership
	    \item Department granting your degree
	    \item School address
	    \item Distribution statement
	    \item Disclaimer
     \end{itemize} 
\end{tabular}

\noindent Add this information to {\em titlePage.tex} as you obtain
it.  One item to include as soon as possible is the distribution
statement; ask your advisor which distribution statement is
appropriate for your draft document.
    
If your document is something other than a thesis, you can set a flag at
the beginning of {\em titlePage.tex}.  Use the $\%$ symbol to comment
out unused flags and remove the $\%$ from the line of the
appropriate flag.  In this way, the correct flag will execute at
compilation.  The available flags correspond to the following
documents:

\vspace{-0.3in}
{\singlespace
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
    \hline
    \bf Document & \bf Flag\\
    \hline
    Thesis & {\bf $\backslash$afitthesis}  \\
    Report & {\bf $\backslash$afitreport} \\
    Dissertation & {\bf $\backslash$dissertation} \\
    Prospectus & {\bf $\backslash$prospectus}\\
    \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}}

Once you customize the {\em titlePage.tex} file, we can typeset
the first four pages of an AFIT thesis: the flypage, the disclaimer
page, the title page and the committee page. 

We must add a few lines to our typesetting program.  Within the
document environment, we list the first four pages (See line 7-11)
under front matter.  The flypage includes our first graphic---the AFIT
logo---so we provide a path to our figures by using the {\bf
$\backslash$graphicspath} command\footnote{Note the double brackets
used in the graphicspath command; they are necessary for the command
to execute properly with some compilers.} in the preamble.  Note line
3 below where we set the path.  The {\em titlePage.tex} provides
customization, not content, so it is called in the preamble;
call the file by using the command {\bf $\backslash$input} as in line
4 of the code below.  In all, we have added seven lines of code to our
short program to create a four page document.
