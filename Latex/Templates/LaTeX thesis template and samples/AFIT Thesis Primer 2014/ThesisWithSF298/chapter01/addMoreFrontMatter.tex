Other common items that can be added to the front matter are
acknowledgements, the table of contents and lists of figures and
tables.  The acknowledgements can be added in the same manner as the
abstract; use the environment commands for the
Acknowledgement: {\bf $\backslash$begin\{acknowledgement\}} and {\bf
$\backslash$end\{acknowledgement\}}.  The table of contents and other lists
build automatically as you add sections, figures, and tables and are placed
in the front matter using the commands below.  

\vspace{-0.3in} {\singlespace
\begin{verbatim}
\frontmatter
        \flyleaf                        
        \disclaimerpage                 
        \titlepageAFIT                      
        \committeepage
        \input{Front/abstract}
        \input{Front/acknowledgement}
        \tableofcontents
        \listoffigures
        \listoftables
\end{verbatim}
}

\noindent The order follows the AFIT style guide\cite{AFITStyle}.  The {\em
afitThesis.sty} defines additional environments and lists.  We
will describe how to implement those items in the next chapter.
For now, we will simply keep the abstract and perhaps the list of
figures in our front matter as we move on to the
main body of the thesis.
