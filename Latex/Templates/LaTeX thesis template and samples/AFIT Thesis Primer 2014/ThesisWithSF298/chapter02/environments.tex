The afitThesis style file defines the customized environments for the
front matter, main matter, and back matter.  The three front matter
environments are the dedication, acknowledgements, and preface.  The
three main matter environments are comment, quotation, and quote.  The
one back matter environment is the vita.  Each environment follows the
same syntax:

\begin{verbatim}
    \begin{environment_name}
        Enter text here...
    \end{environment_name}
\end{verbatim}

Below we discuss the intention of each customized environment starting
with the front matter environments. 

\subsection{Custom front matter environments}

The three front matter environments are the dedication,
acknowledgements, and preface.  These environments each define a new
page for their specific content:

The dedication environment is used to provide a
short tribute.  

The acknowledgements are used to thank those who
contributed to the writing of the document.  The intension of the
acknowledgement is to thank those who made a technical contributions
and these people can be named.  Family members may be thanked but do
not use their name in full or part.  

The preface introduces the material in a tone that is more more
editorial than that used the abstract.


\subsection{Custom main matter environments}

The three main matter environments are comment, quotation, and quote.
The customized main matter environments are used to set text apart.
The comment is the least subtle and is used for warnings.  When
compiled, the comment preceded by a boxed an exclamation point.  The
text that follows is not indented.

Quotation and quote result in similar forms.  Each environment
uses narrow left and right margins to set off the quote 
from the surrounding text.  The first line of a quotation
is indented while the quote is not.


\subsection{Custom back matter environment}

The back matter environment is the vita.  The vita environment
provides information on the author.  The content should focus on the
author's professional career.
